Your decision to participate is voluntary, and you are free to withdraw at any time. You are not required to answer any questions you do not feel comfortable answering. You are not required to complete any task you do not feel comfortable completing. There will be no negative consequences for withdrawing or not completing any tasks or questions. There are no conditions for the withdrawal of your data if you do choose to withdraw.\n\n\nI understand the following:\n* The purpose of the study is to examine cognitive load in computer science education.\n* I will be asked to participate in an experiment requiring me to provide input to a computer using professional and consumer-grade sensing and display devices. Specifically, I will be completing a series of coding exercises on a desktop computer using eye-tracker goggles and a wristband.\n* I have been asked to participate as someone who would exhibit typical behaviors with interactive technologies. \n* The study will take place in in-lab experiments lasting approximately 60 minutes.\n* The study will take place in the DGP Lab at University of Toronto downtown campus, Bahen Centre for Information Technology, 40 St George St, 5th Floor, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4\n* The researchers do not foresee any risks or stresses related to the research methodology, beyond what one might experience in day-to-day living and interacting with consumer electronics devices.\n* By participating in this study I will have the opportunity to experience cutting-edge research computing environments. No other direct benefits are associated with the study.  \n* I will be compensated a total of $20.\n* All data collected about me will be kept secure. In all data files, my name and identifying features will be removed and replaced with a code in order to preserve my confidentiality. Only the researchers involved in this study will have access to the information I provide. The data collected will be destroyed 5 years after publication of results.\n* Video and audio recordings or frame grabs of the session may be used in published materials or in presentations of this research. I am free to consent or not consent to their usage without any negative consequences, as per the options provided in the printed version of this consent form (presented to you beforehand)\n* Data collected may be used in research journals, conferences, or other scholarly activities. In these cases, my name will not be used and will be replaced with an identifier (e.g., Participant 1) and no identifying information will be provided to the audience.\n* I do not meet any of the exclusion criteria of the study – I am 18-40 years old, Introduction to Computer Science (CS1) level student, have normal or corrected to normal vision, and no major physical impairments.\n* I am free to ask questions about the process at any time. I can ask questions in person, or by contacting Tovi Grossman at tovi@dgp.toronto.edu or by telephone at 416-978-6763.\n* If requested, I will receive a copy of this form for my records.\n* To learn about publications arising from this work, I can visit: [www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi](www.dgp.toronto.edu/~tovi)\n\n\n### Additional Considerations due to COVID-19:\n* Research site is in the DGP Lab at University of Toronto downtown campus, Bahen Centre for Information Technology, 40 St George St, 5th Floor, Toronto, ON M5S 2E4, under the jurisdiction of Toronto public health. We are taking all safety precautions to reduce the risk of spread of COVID-19 and expect you to follow public health directives as well.\n* If you feel that you are from a vulnerable group with respect to COVID-19 effects (e.g., senior, immuno-compromised), please discuss your participation with the research team before consenting. Individuals deemed to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 than the general population will not be able to participate. You are under no obligation to participate and nothing bad will happen if you change your mind about participating in the research.\n* Because you are coming onto campus, the following safety protocols must be followed, as per Occupational Health and Safety:\n  * Screening–as per requirements for persons coming onto campus.\n  * Take appropriate precautions(e.g.g.face covering/cloth mask) if taking public transportation and entering public indoor spaces.\n  * Wash your hands upon coming onto campus / entrance to the building. Hand sanitizer will be made available to you.\n  * Physical distancing will be maintained, at all times, and if not possible wear a face covering / cloth mask. Otherwise we will provide you with PPE.\n* We will be collecting personal contact information that we must retain in order to follow up with you and/or conduct contact tracing if you may have been exposed to COVID-19 in coming to the research site.\n* Contact information will be kept separate from data collected through the research study to allow for de-identification of the research data.\n* You maintain your right to withdraw from the study at any time, including research data. If you do withdraw, we will continue to maintain your contact information and will only give it to Occupational Health if required for contact tracing.\n* We cannot guarantee anonymity as the personal contact information identifies you as a participant.\n 						\n			\nThe research study you are participating in may be reviewed for quality assurance to make sure that the required laws and guidelines are followed. If chosen, (a) representative(s) of the Human Research Ethics Program (HREP) may access study-related data and/or consent materials as part of the review. All information accessed by the HREP will be upheld to the same level of confidentiality that has been stated by the research team.\n\n\nIf you have any questions about your rights as a participant, please contact the Ethics Review Office at ethics.review@utoronto.ca or (416) 946-3273","Placeholder for instructions.
